                HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the standard language used to create web pages. 
                <br>
                HTML provides the structure for the web pages and is responsible for the proper formatting of text and images.<br>
                It allows the use of templates so designing a webpage can be done easily.<br>
                It is lightweight and fast.<br>

                <p>
                    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is often used with HTML to  style of a webpage. 
                    The size, color and positions of all elements in a web page are determined by CSS.
                    <br>
                    It has a cascading style, meaning throughout a webpage, an applied style will cascade down from parent to child.<br> 
                    It supports responsive web design.<br>
                    CSS upholds consistency due to its cascading nature.<br>

                <p>
                    JS can be used for both frontend and backend web development. It is used to add interactivity to 
                    web pages and also includes several libraries and frameworks. JavaScript is used to 
                    create dynamic web elements like clickable buttons or animated graphics.
                    <br>
                    It is a lightweight programming language.<br>
                    The syntax is simple and easy to learn.<br>
                    Besides web development, it can be used for developing mobile apps, games, and web servers.<br>

                    Python is an open-source language that is easy to learn and use.
                    It is used for backend development, data science, web app development and automation. 
                    It has a huge collection of standard libraries. 
                    <br>
                    It has dynamic typing capabilities which makes it easy to create complex websites that need constant content changes.
                    It is an efficient backend web development language. 
                    It can be associated with frameworks like Django and Flask to create web-based applications.

                <p>
                    In 1990, Sun Microsystems developed Java. It was built on the Write Once Run 
                    Anywhere principle. Java is used as backend languages for web development. 
                    It follows the OOP concepts, has open-source feature-rich libraries and high productivity. 
                    <br>
                    Java supports multithreading so multiple threads can be executed concurrently.<br>
                    It supports vertical and horizontal scaling with only slight code changes.<br>
                    It can handle massive amounts of data and is highly secure. <br>

                <p>
                    Typescript is an open-source programming language.
                    It is similar to JavaScript in syntax and semantics & is often called JavaScript++. 
                    Being more powerful than JavaScript, Typescript supports the development of enterprise-level applications with 
                    large codebases.
                    <br>
                    Has several inbuilt debugging tools that make development simple.<br>
                    It is a type-safe language, hence type-related errors are reduced.<br>
                    Supported by Visual Studio Code, Microsoftâ€™s free code editor. <br>

                    PHP or Hypertext Preprocessor is an open-source scripting language used for back-end development. 
                    It is mostly used for developing dynamic, data-heavy websites and is an interpreted language. 
                    It is one of the most popular web page language. 
                    <br>
                    It is supported by many third-party extensions like .NET, MySQL, and Apache.<br> 
                    It can output images, PDF, text, animations, and HTML.<br> 
                    It is compatible with cloud services.<br>

                <p>
                    Angular is mostly used for  front-end languages that allows dynamic modeling. 
                    It supports the development of complicated applications. 
                    For UI development, Angular makes use of HTML.
                    With Angular, you can develop projects with extensive functionality and appealing design most efficiently. 
                    <br>
                    It utilizes templates to make development quick and easy.
                    It uses extensions like Snippet and Angular Command Line Interface to simplify the development.
                    Using Angular Filters, data is filtered before reaching the view.
